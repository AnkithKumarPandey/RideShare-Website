# RideShare-Website
RideShare is a full-stack web application designed to offer a cost-effective and efficient ride-sharing service, enabling 
users to book and share rides seamlessly. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and powered by 
Node.js, Express, and MySQL on the back-end, the platform provides an intuitive interface for both riders and drivers. 
Users can create accounts, search for available rides, and request a ride based on their location and destination. 
Drivers can post available rides, track their bookings, and manage schedules in real time. 
 
The platform focuses on reducing transportation costs by encouraging shared rides, thereby optimizing vehicle 
occupancy and minimizing fuel consumption. By implementing real-time ride tracking and dynamic pricing models, 
RideShare enhances user experience and promotes efficient urban mobility. The integration of secure user 
authentication and database management ensures the safety and reliability of user data. 
 
RideShare not only contributes to reducing traffic congestion and emissions but also offers a scalable, technology
driven solution for modern transportation challenges.
